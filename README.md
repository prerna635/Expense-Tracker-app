# 📊 Expense Tracker with Data Visualization 

This project is part of my **#30DayProject** challenge.  
On **Day 22**, I built a **Python-based Expense Tracker** with a GUI and charts to visualize spending habits.  
It allows users to add expenses, categorize them, store them in a database, and view them in an interactive table and charts.
